# The Callahan Conundrum

The Callahan Conundrum is a longitudinal football analytics project that began as an attempt to evaluate the impact of a new head coach, but evolved into a broader investigation of systemic failure within the Tennessee Titans franchise.
The initial question was narrow: did Brian Callahan meaningfully worsen team performance, and should his retention be viewed as a mistake? However, as play-level efficiency, play-calling tendencies, and historical outcome data were analyzed, the evidence consistently failed to isolate coaching as the primary driver of decline.
Instead, the analysis revealed persistent patterns across decades — recurring efficiency constraints, conservative offensive identities, short contention windows followed by sharp collapses, and a repeated misalignment between process and results — that transcended individual coaches, rosters, and eras.
The project reframes coach-centric explanations for failure as incomplete, arguing that the Titans’ struggles are better understood as structural and organizational in nature. The central contribution of the analysis is not defending or indicting any single coach, but demonstrating how franchises can repeatedly produce similar outcomes while cycling leadership and narratives, mistaking continuity for change.

## Project Structure

- `/python/` – Data collection, cleaning, and analysis scripts
- `/data/` – Source and intermediate datasets (where applicable)
- Methodology – Detailed explanation of data sources, metric definitions, and analytical assumptions
- Published analysis – Linked written explanations and visualizations (see external links)

## Methods

All data sources, metric definitions, and analytical decisions are documented in the **Methodology** section.  
This includes explanations of EPA, success rate, PROE, and long-term rating-based measures such as SRS.

## Notes

This project is ongoing and intended as a portfolio piece demonstrating applied data analysis, reproducible workflows, and the ability to communicate quantitative findings to a general audience.
